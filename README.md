# NOTE! THIS ADDON IS IN ALPHA DEVELOPMENT!
# Loot Filter
You want to delete useless items? Great, me too. I wrote an addon that'll allow you to select them by certain criteria and then delete them.

# AGAIN, ALPHA!
The vast majority of all items in Rift are currently untested!
This means that there is the very, VERY high possibility of selecting an item that you DO NOT want to delete!
Thankfully, the addon will show you what may end up getting deleted.
As long as you exercise caution with the /lf delete command, you shouldn't end up with any unnecessary item loss.

# AAAAAAAAAAALPHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!
All items deleted are solely the responsibility of the end user.
Be advised that readjusting your inventory space after applying filters may potentially break the addon. It is untested, to be quite frank.
Did we mention that this is an alpha addon?

# Filters?
Current filters:
- rift items
- scrolls
- grey items
- dimension items (not keys and not crates)
- non lv70 gear

# Why not just allow us to select the items from a list?
As a multiboxer, I wanted a more manageable way that could be done with mouse broadcasting across all clients.
Feel free to fork and work with the Inspect.Item.List() item list to make an addon that can allow the user to select specific items.

# Ownership?
Don't care. Feel free to slap a shiny sticker on your blatant copy stating that you own it exclusively. Timestamps will tell the true tale.
Honestly I'm just throwing this code out here to hopefully spark interest in Rift addon dev. Scene's pretty dry and there's lots of addon ideas to take up. 
Seriously. Just ask around for ideas, and learn what the API can and can't do. Maybe one day Gamigo will give us more API possibilities. 
Until then, let's bleed the current API dry of all its possibilites. :)
