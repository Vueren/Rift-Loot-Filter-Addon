# NOTE! THIS ADDON IS IN BETA DEVELOPMENT

## Loot Filter

You want to delete useless items? Great, me too.

I wrote an addon that'll allow you to select them, and then automatically delete them whenever they end up back in your inventory.

Each Loot Filter is *PER CHARACTER*.

## AGAIN! BETA

Type /lf to open the Loot Filter!

Select an item by left clicking it. See all identical items in other slots in the inventory gain a yellow border.

Use the Display Only Selected Items checkbox to see what should be getting deleted if you enable the deletion functionality.

Once you are feeling brave and confident, checking Automatically Delete Selected Items will give you a confirmation box.

Once you are *extremely* certain about things... Start! Watch the names of the items that are deleted show up in your General chat tab. See the emptied slots in your Inventory.

Uncheck the Automatically Delete Selected Items box if you do not want to automatically delete items anymore.

## BEEEEEEEEEEEETTTTTTTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Uncheck Automatically Delete Selected Items, get the item again, and Deselect the item if you want to stop deleting that item.

Alternatively (nuclear option), use /lfnull to reset *ALL* of the addon's Selected Items for your character. Note that you cannot bring the settings for the selected items back - you will need to select them again using the addon as you obtain them.

## Did we mention that this is an beta addon?

The primary reason this addon is in beta is that it *needs testing*. As the addon developer, I cannot be 100% certain that there isn't an Error State, or that there isn't an item that is deleted somewhere that shouldn't be.

As the addon developer, I *am*, however, reasonably confident enough in my code to put it into Beta, instead of Alpha.

Please send any and all error messages my way via my Discord at Vueren#9253. If you are in the Heroes of Telara Discord, you should be able to DM me directly. I do not accept friend requests.
